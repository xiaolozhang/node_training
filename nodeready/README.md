NodeReady at PayPal with The Node Firm
======================================

## Getting ready for Node.js

* Read lots of code.
* Write lots of code.
* Don’t be afraid to throw it away.
* Don’t be afraid to share it.
* Find your happy place writing tests.
    * You’ll probably spend more time writing tests and debugging than writing code. Embrace this. Make it a key part of your workflow.
    * Tests are one of the first things I read in a module. That and the example(s). Probably before API docs.
    * Don’t know where to start. Write some tests for a module you like. This benefits everyone.
* Focus.
    * You’ll improve your overall skill set most effectively by choosing something that really clicks for you and diving deep into that thing.

## Read the docs. No, really.

* Node.js
    * http://nodejs.org/api/
* npm
    * https://npmjs.org/doc/
* Express.js
    * http://expressjs.com/guide.html
    * http://expressjs.com/api.html
* Kraken.js
    * http://krakenjs.com/
    * http://krakenjs.com/#Examples

## JavaScript, too

* MDN JavaScript reference
    * https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference
    

## Working in an open-source environment

* If something isn’t clear, write something yourself. Share this with someone you trust. Avoid pedantry. Contribute what you and others find meaningful.
* If something is missing in docs, and you figured it out, PRing it back will make it easy for everybody else. Same goes to missing features as well.
* Do not hesitate to file issues/questions against the git hub repo.
.... And again, do not hesitate to contribute back, which is the core idea behind open source projects.



## Leveling-up even more

* Share
    * Code
    * What worked for you?
    * What was hard? What help you break through?
* Teach and Write
    * There is always someone who isn’t quite as far along on their journey as you are. Help them. Help those who are sincerely interested.
    * Teaching others will force you to understand things more deeply.
    * Often in explaining something to someone else, you will improve your own understanding of that thing.
